Are the variable and method names meaningful and descriptive?
Yes the names are all meaningful and convey their utility. Additionally, constants are
named with all caps.

Does the code follow coding conventions and formatting standards? Has it made appropriate use of includes? Are static members used properly?
Static members are used properly and coding conventions are well followed. Static has only been used on constants and the main, which is correct. Coding conventions are also being followed, such as; variable naming, line length, methods only doing one thing, and more.

Are the classes properly encapsulated? Are member variables private? Are accessor and mutator methods used?
Classes are properly encapsulated through the use of private member variables and private methods. There are no accessor and mutator methods, this is bad practice as playerOneTurn and board should have said conventions.

Is there any duplication of code in this project? Are there methods that do essentially the same thing, or parts of the same thing that could be made into smaller methods?
There is no duplicate code and methods are all unique and modularized.

Does each class and method have a single, obvious purpose or responsibility? Are there any long methods that should be broken up into smaller methods?
Each method has its own responsibility and do not need to be broken down into smaller methods. Logic is well distributed throughout and it is clear what each method does.

Functionality:
The code is entirely function and plays smoothly, showing the board after each move, skipping opponents stores, and overall maintaining usability.

Completeness:
The code is complete and offers a print method that conveniently prints the board after each turn. Additionally, it has a method to check if the game is over or not.

Suggestions:
- For enhanced user experience, maybe add more than just the board, perhaps player name prompts.
- Modularize further to separate game logic and UI for better maintainability.
